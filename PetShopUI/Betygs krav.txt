Read about classes here:
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Sharp_Programming/Classes
Focus on the following headings: Methods, Constructors, Properties.

Also read https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Sharp_Programming/Objects
And read https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Sharp_Programming/Encapsulation - the chapters private, protected and public.

Answer the following questions as a comment in your code.//Done
1. When should you use private instead of public?
2. When is it useful to have multiple constructor functions?

Your exercise for this week is to build a simple program with a class hierarchy. Imagine a pet shop, that sells different kinds of animals.//Done

Create a class named AnimalShop that represents the pet shop.//Done

Features:

- Create one class for each animal (at least three) that the shop can sell.// Done

- Each animal class should have at least three properties.//Done

- Also create a class Animal that contains whatever properties all animals have in common. For example, each animal needs a price.//Done 

- Make sure that each specific animal class inherits from Animal.//Done


- AnimalShop should have a method "public Animal SellAnimal(string animalType)" that returns an animal of the specified type.
If there is no such animal, for example if the user asks for a "crocodile" but you don't have a class Crocodile, it should return null. //Done

- When an animal is sold, the AnimalShop object should gain money.//Done

- Store the money in a property.//Done

- Finally write a program that tests your classes (Menu).//Done

  - It should create an object of the class AnimalShop.//Done

  - Then buy some animals and print the values of all their properties.//Done
